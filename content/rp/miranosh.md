# Profile

## History
Miranosh gra-Shar was born into a weak Orsimer clan that had suffered a devastating defeat in battle. After the loss, the clan decided that Miranosh was not worth keeping due to her small and weak stature.  She was cast out into the wilderness and forgotten. Alone and hungry, Miranosh struggled to survive on her own. 

One day, she was discovered by a travelling Breton named Rodyn.  He took pity on her and took her under his wing. He taught her the basics of magic and showed her how to create amazing dishes using the ingredients they gathered on their travels. As they journeyed together, Miranosh's skills as a cook and herbalist began to flourish. She learned how to create complex dishes using only the most basic ingredients.  Her culinary creations never failed to bring a smile to the people they encountered on their travels.  

But it wasn't just her cooking skills that blossomed under the Breton's guidance.  Miranosh also developed a deep love and respect for summoning magic. Not only did she create creatures who could help her hunt, they could also be her friends.

Despite the challenges they faced on their journey, Miranosh was happy with Rodyn by her side. She felt like she had finally found a sense of belonging and purpose in life, and she was content to spend her days travelling and spreading culinary arts throughout Tamriel.  

However, their time together was short-lived. One fateful day, the Breton was killed by members of the Gray Host.  All Miranosh could do was hide and watch as they mauled the man she loved so dearly to death.  Devastated and unsure of what to do next, Miranosh decided to become a nomad, travelling alone and relying on her hunting and cooking skills to survive.

Miranosh never forgot the lessons Rodyn had taught her. She continued to hone her culinary and magical skills on the road, hoping that one day she could find companionship and love again.

## Personality
Miranosh's mentor, Rodyn, had always taught her to be honest and tolerant.  Being an Orc, she constantly faced discrimination and harassment.  But Rodyn was always there to protect her even when it disadvantaged him.  He never discriminated to whom he served his dishes, since all he cared about was the quality of his cooking.  This left a deep impression on her.  

Because of Rodyn's tolerance, Miranosh can be quite naive and idealistic.  She is often lost in thought and easily distracted.  She had learned how to distract herself on particularly uneventful days on the road.  This flightiness sometimes makes her appear scatterbrained or unreliable, but it also allows her to see things from multiple perspectives and come up with creative solutions.

Miranosh's experience being abandoned over and over ingrained a seed of doubt in her hopeful mind.  She is quite paranoid and tends to worry about things that others might not and imagines crazy worst-case scenarios.  

Miranosh is also quite shy and introverted.  She prefers the company of her familiars, often mourning the loss of her mentor even after so many years have past since his death.  Miranosh is constatly struggling between hopefullness and fear of the future.

## Appearance
Miranosh gra-Shar is an orc of smaller stature, standing at around 5'10" and possessing a slim build that is not typical of her kind. Her demeanor is reserved, and she seems almost shy at times, preferring to keep to herself rather than engage in the usual boisterous orcish behavior.

Despite her unassuming appearance, there are still clear signs that she is an orc. Her underbite and tusks are prominently displayed, and her skin has a slightly greenish hue. However, there is a certain softness to her features that belies her race. Her large, expressive eyes are a green hue and her nose is small and pert. Her hair is a rich black color and is often worn in a high ponytail, presumably to keep it out of her way while she cooks.

Even though light or medium armours would be much more practical for hunting or her daily activities, Miranosh has a certain affinity for heavy armour like most orcs. She wears a suit of intricately crafted plate armor that is adorned with intricate carvings, making her look the part of a small fierce warrior.  While her choice of heavy armor may seem impractical, it also adds a certain intimidating quality to her already prominent orcish features. Her tusks and underbite are even more noticeable as they jut out from beneath her helmet.

## Motivations
The loss of Rodyn is still the main thing on Miranosh's mind.  The void in her heart feels so vast and overwhelming.  Whatever she does she can't seem to fill that void.  She feels lost and confused, all she knows is the truth of her mentor's teachings.  Those words are what keeps her going.  Will she find a way out of this rut and find her own meaning in life?
