## History
Miraselene is a young human standing at an above average height for her kind. She was born into poverty in the Old World, and when her parents died of illness, she was sold into slavery to impoverished nobles. She spent years serving her masters, enduring their cruelty and suffering in silence.

But when her masters brought her to Albion in search of fortune, their ship crashed.  She washed ashore and fled into the woods of Celidon.  Life was hard and she quickly learned the way of the bow and knife, surviving by hunting squirrels and foxes.

In her anger and anguish, Miraselene turned to curse magic to seek revenge against her former masters. She found that she had a natural talent for the dark arts, and her powers grew with every spell she cast. But she soon realized that the magic was consuming her, and she felt herself slipping deeper into darkness.

In a desperate bid to save herself, Miraselene turned to the light magic of healing. She devoted herself to learning the ways of the healers, and found solace in the power of the light. But even as she healed the wounds of others, she struggled to control her own affinity for the darkness. She felt torn between her desire for revenge and her need for redemption, and feared that she would never find peace.

Despite her inner turmoil, Miraselene remains a formidable and dangerous opponent. She is a skilled archer, able to strike her targets with deadly accuracy. And though she strives to use her curse magic only in the most dire of situations, she knows that the darkness within her is always waiting to be unleashed. 

## Appearance
Miraselene is a reserved figure, tall and slender with an unassuming presence. Her long black hair falls in loose waves down her back, and she often tucks it behind her ear when it falls in her face. Her features are softly defined, with a delicate nose and a gentle curve to her jawline.

Her light olive skin is smooth and unblemished, save for a few shallow scars that crisscross her arms and legs. They are too slight to have come from weapons, and appear instead to be the result of old wounds that have long since healed.

She is reserved but moves with a quiet grace that speaks of inner strength. Her body is lean and toned, honed by years in the wilderness. She wears simple, practical clothing that allows her to move freely.  She carries a sturdy bow visible for all to see, but hides her wands under her cloak.

In her dark eyes, there is a depth of emotion that is not immediately visible on the surface. She often appears lost in thought, as if pondering some weighty matter.  If you look closely you can see a fierce determination that drives her forward.

## Personality
Miraselene is a reserved and private individual.  She keeps her thoughts and emotions closely guarded. Her experiences as a slave have made her deeply mistrustful of others and she is slow to open up to anyone. Despite her distant demeanor, those who take the time to get to know her will come to see her emotional side.

Miraselene's values stem from her past as a slave, where survival was her primary concern. She believes in doing whatever it takes to stay alive and avoid being taken advantage of by others. Her pragmatic outlook on life often leads her to make difficult decisions that others might find morally questionable.

While Miraselene does not have a deep sense of justice, she does believe in standing up for herself and protecting what is hers. She is not afraid to use force if necessary to defend herself or those she cares about. This protectiveness also extends to her abilities with curse magic, which she uses to keep potential threats at bay.

Despite her reservations and self-reliance, Miraselene is not completely closed off to the idea of forming bonds with others. However, she is highly selective in choosing those she lets into her inner circle and is not easily swayed by the opinions of others. Those who do earn her trust and loyalty will find a fiercely devoted ally who will stop at nothing to protect what is hers.

## Prompts
> **Given an Impossible Task**
>
> They want us to do WHAT??? I can't believe this.  There's no way we can collect all that wood and hides in how little time we are given.  It looks like they really don't want us... but why couldn't they tell us?  Instead they give us this task... is it to humilate us? 

> **Resurfacing Trauma = Bad News**
>
> Miraselene felt the fire within her burn.  It was hot and only growing... She could barely hear the calls from her party members from behind her as she charged in filled with rage.  The cloak that had so delicately covered her couldn't even keep up, flying off her slender body to reveal the burning curse wand concealed underneath.  In that moment even her party members felt fear, a fear that stoked her fire to burn even hotter...

> **Pilgrimage**
>
> Miraselene travels with a group of pilgrims to a holy site far away from the demons and heretics.  She has felt an emotion she never wants to feel again.  What will this adventure teach her?  Will she learn how to supress her curse magic or will something go wrong?
