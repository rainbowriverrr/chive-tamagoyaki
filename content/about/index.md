# Introduction


Hi there, I'm Chive, a proud 20-year-old woman who embraces her inner nerd. From my love of anime and gaming to my passion for roleplaying and coding, I'm always seeking out new and exciting ways to engage with my interests. But I'm not just a nerd - I'm also a playful and slightly quirky person, and I bring that unique perspective to everything I do. Whether I'm creating captivating content for work or pursuing my hobbies in my free time, I always strive to inject a bit of creativity and fun into everything I do. So come along with me on this journey through the wonderfully wacky world of nerddom, and let's see where our shared passions take us!

# Backstory
Growing up, I always struggled to find my place in the world. But one thing that always brought me comfort was technology. I loved tinkering with computers and gadgets, and the virtual world became my refuge. As I got older, I began to come out of my shell and find my voice. I experienced a "glow up," if you will. Now, I'm equally comfortable being the life of the party as I am immersing myself in virtual worlds. You might find me dancing the night away at a club one night and huddled over my computer the next. Through my love of technology, I've discovered a whole new world of possibilities and connections that I never could have imagined as a shy child. And I'm excited to see where this passion takes me next.
